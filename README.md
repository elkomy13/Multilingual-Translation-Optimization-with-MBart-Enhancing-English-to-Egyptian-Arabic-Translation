# Multilingual-Translation-Optimization-with-MBart-Enhancing-English-to-Egyptian-Arabic-Translation

**Project Description:**

In this project, we aim to enhance machine translation performance utilizing the `MBart` model, specifically `mbart-large-cc25`, which is renowned for its multilingual capabilities. Leveraging the power of the `MBart` architecture, we seek to translate English text to Egyptian Arabic. The dataset consists of subtitles, curated to facilitate effective training.

**Model Configuration:**

For this endeavor, we employ the `mbart-large-cc25` transformer model along with the corresponding tokenizer provided by Facebook. This model has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus, enabling it to handle various linguistic nuances effectively. The utilization of this specific model allows for high-quality translations between English and Egyptian Arabic.

**Training Parameters:**

To fine-tune the `MBart` model for our translation task, we initialize the training process with a batch size of 4 and a learning rate of `5e-5`. Furthermore, the training data is organized into epochs, each encompassing multiple iterations to optimize the model's performance.

**Challenges Encountered:**

Despite the extensive capabilities of the `mbart-large-cc25` model, challenges arose during training, primarily attributed to its size. The large-scale architecture posed computational constraints, hindering the model's ability to achieve desired translation accuracy efficiently.

**Proposed Solution:**

To address the performance limitations stemming from the model's size, we propose exploring alternative architectures better suited to the computational resources available. Additionally, adjusting the batch size and potentially fine-tuning the learning rate could optimize training dynamics, leading to improved translation accuracy.

**Future Directions:**

Moving forward, we plan to experiment with alternative transformer architectures tailored to our specific requirements, considering factors such as computational efficiency and translation quality. By iteratively refining our approach and harnessing advancements in natural language processing, we aim to achieve superior translation results for English to Egyptian Arabic.
